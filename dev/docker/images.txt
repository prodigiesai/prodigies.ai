### **Summary of Common Services:**

1. **PHP with NGINX/Apache** – This is the most common setup. You'll likely need at least one **NGINX** or **Apache** instance to run the PHP-based apps.
   - Apps: **13 apps**
   
2. **Java (Tomcat/Jetty)** – You'll need a **Tomcat** or **Jetty** instance for the Java-based apps.
   - Apps: **5 apps**

3. **Python (Gunicorn/UWSGI)** – For Python-based apps, setting up a **Gunicorn/UWSGI** instance would be necessary.
   - Apps: **6 apps**

4. **Ruby on Rails (Puma/Passenger)** – Ruby on Rails apps typically run on **Puma** or **Passenger**, so you'd need an instance for these.
   - Apps: **2 apps**

5. **Node.js** – For **Ghost** and similar apps, you'll need at least one **Node.js** runtime.
   - Apps: **2 apps**

By setting up **5 common services** (PHP/NGINX, Java/Tomcat, Python/Gunicorn, Ruby/Puma, Node.js), you can cover the majority of the applications. This will ensure streamlined management and avoid redundant services.
